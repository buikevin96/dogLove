	<p> What is not to love about dogs. Dogs are man's best friends. There are so many different types of dogs out there. Did you know that your dog is as smart as a 2 year old toddler? Dogs and cat both slurp water the same way. Your dog does have a sense of time - and misses you when you're gone. Your dog's whiskers help him "see" in the dark. </p>

	<p> The domestic dog, not to be confused with their extant gray wolf, is a member of genus Canis that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millenia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior. </p>
